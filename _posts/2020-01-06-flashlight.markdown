I learned how to use a mill and a lathe to make a flashlight in 2.670 Mechanical Engineering Tools!

This course was a fun 3-day class that I took during IAP. We were briefed on operating many machines, with the end goal of producing a small flashlight. The head of the flashlight was mostly made on a mill, while the body, on a lathe.
