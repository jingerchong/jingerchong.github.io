I built a Metal Earth Iron Man model and then made a custom display case!

After my first two Metal Earth models, I decided to challenge myself by going straight to what their [website](https://www.metalearth.com/iron-man/) tagged extremely difficult. I finished it in about two days. It sat proudly on my desk, but it inevitably also started collecting dust.

Fast forward six months later, I got my first power tool, a Dremel 4000 4-65. and debuted it by creating a display case from scratch.

The result was an oil-finished, wax-coated wood base with the word *Iron Man* and his Marvel logo embossed, paired with five panels of acrylic, all held together by two latch fasteners.
