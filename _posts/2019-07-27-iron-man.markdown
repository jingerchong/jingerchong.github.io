After piecing together my first two Metal Earth models, I decided to challenge myself by jumping straight to what their [website](https://www.metalearth.com/iron-man/) tagged as "extremely difficult." I finished this Iron Man model in about two days. It sat proudly on my desk, but it inevitably started collecting dust.

Frustrated, I decided to build a display case from scratch six months later. Armed with my only power tool, a *Dremel 4000 4-65 kit*, I embarked on my first woodworking project.

The result was an oil-finished, wax-coated wood base with the word *Iron Man* and his Marvel logo embossed, paired with five panels of clear acrylic, held together by two latch fasteners.
