ReVise is an integrated vise solution designed to hold tightly onto irregular workpieces without damaging them. The metal vise houses a self-regulated pneumatic system attached to two removable pouches. Through *granular jamming*, the pouches can conform to any geometry and hold their shape. As a result, the clamping force is distributed over a larger contact area, improving grip while minimizing risk.  

This was the product our 20-member team proudly showcased last December 6, 2021 in Kresge Auditorium for the capstone project class *2.009 Product Engineering Processes*. During the presentation, we successfully clamped a raw egg without cracking its shell! To get to that point, we went through a lengthy yet awesome journey best summed up by Prof. David Wallace as *"Ideate. Model. Test. Repeat"*.
