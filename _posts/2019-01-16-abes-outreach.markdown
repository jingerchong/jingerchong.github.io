We held an introduction to robotics workshop at Andres Bonifacio Elementary School (ABES), a local public school hoping to enhance their STEM program. The workshop was requested by a teacher from ABES. We had a turnout of about 50 students from 4th to 6th grade.

I collaborated with my school's robotics club to gather resources and volunteers. Due to scheduling constraints, we only had 2 weeks to organize everything, but in the end, I think we somehow pulled it off. Everyone left with a smile!

I like to believe we all learned important lessons from each other that day. It definitely helped me hone my teaching methods and realize the privilege I have. Since I led the workshop, I also got to practice my public speaking and comedy skills.
