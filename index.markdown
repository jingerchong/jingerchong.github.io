To answer the burning question, my name is pronounced like *ginger*.
      
I'm an SM-PhD student at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu) in **Mechanical Engineering** with a passion for Robotics and Perception. I like building things, and then making them to do stuff for me. Oh, and I like Japanese food.
      
I'm always on the lookout for any opportunity to learn new skills and technology. Feel free to [reach out](#footer)!
