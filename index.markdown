To answer the burning question, my name is pronounced like the root crop, ginger.
      
I'm an undergrad (incoming grad) student at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu), majoring in **Mechanical Engineering** with a concentration in Controls, Instrumentation, and Robotics (Course 2A-6). I like building things, and then making them to do stuff for me. Oh, and I like Japanese food.
      
I'm always on the lookout for any opportunity to learn new skills. Feel free to [reach out](#footer)!
