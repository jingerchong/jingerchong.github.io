## [About](https://jingerchong.com/about/)

| To answer the burning question, my name is pronounced like the root crop, ginger. <br /> <br /> I’m an undergrad at [MIT](https://mit.edu/), majoring in **Mechanical Engineering** with a concentration in Controls, Instrumentation, and Robotics (Course 2A-6). I like building things, and then making them to do stuff for me. Oh, and I like Japanese food. <br /> <br /> I’m always on the lookout for any opportunity to learn new skills.
