To answer the burning question, my name is pronounced like *ginger*.
      
I'm an SM-PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu) with a strong passion for **Robotics and Perception**. I like building things, and then making them to do stuff for me. Oh, and I like Japanese food.
      
I'm always on the lookout for any opportunity to learn new skills and technologies. Feel free to [reach out](#footer)!
