I routed and sanded the top of the base block to make grooves where the acrylic can sit. I then drilled holes to mount the 20mm neodymium magnets and the latches that held everything together. I finished the base block with coats of linseed oil and polished it with beeswax and linseed oil paste. Lastly, I aligned, glued, and attached the acrylic panels.
