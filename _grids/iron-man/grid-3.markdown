section: Iron Man marking

For the marking in front of the base block, I printed a template and traced it on scrap plywood using carbon paper. Since it was my first time carving, I experimented with embossing, engraving, and staining before I decided on plain and embossed. I then etched the entire marking and cleaned it up with small diamond files.
