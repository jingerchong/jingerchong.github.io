- Achieved compression ratios up to 50:1 on raw LiDAR data by adapting H.265 video encoding using FFmpeg, as a result of researching and comparing cutting-edge LiDAR compression schemes for low-latency streaming applications
- Streamlined testing and development of perception pipelines by implementing loading and saving of both video and packet capture files using OpenCV and Libpcap to emulate virtual sensors, eliminating the need for physical sensors
- Developed an application to evaluate the effects of video encoding parameters, such as bitrate, on raw flight footage, enabling dynamic parameter adjustments in the future, which can further reduce bandwidth consumption by up to 3x
- Enhanced flexibility and modularity of LiDAR pipeline, simplifying the integration of new sensors and processes
- Created a streaming app that features optional azimuth-level decimation and supports Velodyne and Robosense LiDARs
